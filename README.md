# PowerBI-Free-CV-Template-4-All

This is just a simple template if you want to create your CV through PowerBI. This was a personal CV I made and fit it for me in 2019, so you may find and order, navigation or focus that doesnt suit you. Feel free to download and make any changes with your personal preferences.

This was made firstly with PowerBI version from Dec-2020 and there are several items, charts and navigation that can be improved with the latest versions in 2022.Please feel free to change or add anything you might consider, improve it, add new pages, update UX/UI and or add the latest charts or navigation improvments from PowerBI.
