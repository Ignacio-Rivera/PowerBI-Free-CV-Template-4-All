# PowerBI-Free-CV-Template-4-All

This is just a simple template if you want to create your CV through PowerBI. This was a personal CV I firstly create in 2020, so you may find and order, navigation or focus on something that doesnt suit you. Feel free to download and make any changes for your personal preferences.

This was made firstly with PowerBI version from Dec-2020 and there are several items, charts and navigation that can be improved with the latest versions. Please feel free to change or add anything you might consider, improve it, add new pages, update UX/UI and or add the latest charts or navigation improvments from PowerBI.

There is no copyright or licence needed to use. 

You can contact for any question or ideas to improve at: ignaciocrivera@outlook.com.

Better Together!


Kind regards,
